  (:documentation "A test suite is a collection of tests or test suites.

Test suites serve to organize tests into groups so that the
developer can chose to run some tests and not just one or
all. Like tests, test suites have a name and a description.

Test suites, like tests, can be part of other test suites, this
allows the developer to create a hierarchy of tests where sub
trees can be singularly run.

Running a test suite has the effect of running every test (or
suite) in the suite."))

  (:documentation "A test case is a single, named, collection of
checks.

A test case is the smallest organizational element which can be run
individually. Every test case has a name, which is a symbol, a
description and a test lambda. The test lambda is a regular
funcall'able function which should use the various checking macros to
collect results.

Every test case is part of a suite, when a suite is not explicitly
specified (either via the :SUITE parameter to the TEST macro or the
global variable *SUITE*) the test is inserted into the global suite
named NIL.

Sometimes we want to run a certain test only if another test has
passed. myam allows us to specify the ways in which one test is
dependent on another.

- AND Run this test only if all the named tests passed.

- OR Run this test if at least one of the named tests passed.

- NOT Run this test only if another test has failed.

myam considers a test to have passed if all the checks executed
were successful, otherwise we consider the test a failure.

When a test is not run due to it's dependencies having failed a
test-skipped result is added to the results."))
